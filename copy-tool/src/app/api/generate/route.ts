- Unaware: Lead with story, identity, or curiosity - not product
- Problem Aware: Agitate the problem, then introduce the solution category
- Solution Aware: Differentiate your approach, explain the unique mechanism
- Product Aware: Focus on proof, testimonials, overcome objections
- Most Aware: Make an offer, create urgency, remind them why they wanted it

## YOUR TASK

Generate copy that:
1. Sounds authentically like Jones Road (confident, effortless, never try-hard)
2. Follows the channel-specific best practices
3. Speaks to the target persona's motivations and pain points (if specified)
4. Uses the appropriate awareness level approach
5. Incorporates unique mechanism thinking when relevant

IMPORTANT:
- Never use words Jones Road avoids (anti-aging, flawless, revolutionary, etc.)
- Use soft benefit language (comfort, enhance, support - not fight, eliminate, combat)
- Remember: beauty is a Level 5 market - lead with identity, not just claims
- Keep the appropriate length and tone for the selected channel

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE - CRITICAL:
- ONLY use product claims that are explicitly listed in the Regulatory Compliance section above
- Never claim "long-wear", "all-day wear", or specific percentages unless explicitly approved for that product
- Never claim "non-comedogenic" or "dermatologist tested" unless listed for that specific product
- Never claim "24-hour hydration" unless it's listed in the product's approved claims
- When in doubt, use softer language like "helps", "may improve", or "designed to"

Output only the copy - no explanations, no meta-commentary. Just the ready-to-use copy.

## COPY REVISION TASK

You are a world-class direct response copywriter for Jones Road Beauty. I've uploaded an existing static ad that needs better copy.

${adFormat ? `## AD FORMAT: ${adFormat.name}

This ad uses the "${adFormat.name}" format. You MUST follow the trained copy patterns for this format.

**FORMAT GUIDELINES:**
${adFormat.specs.styleNotes}

**COPY ZONES TO REVISE:**
${adFormat.specs.copyPlacements.map((p: { zone: string; position: string; style: string; maxChars: number; required: boolean; description?: string }) => `
### ${p.zone.toUpperCase()}
- Max Characters: **${p.maxChars}** (STRICT LIMIT)
- Style: ${p.style}
${p.description ? `- PATTERN/GUIDELINES: ${p.description}` : ""}
`).join("")}

**YOUR TASK:**
1. **ANALYZE THE AD:**
   - Identify the current copy in each zone
   - Note what's working and what isn't
   - Check if current copy follows the format patterns

2. **GENERATE 3 COMPLETE VARIATIONS** that:
   - Follow the EXACT patterns defined above for each zone
   - Stay within character limits
   - Maintain Jones Road voice (confident, honest, warm, direct)
   - Feel specific to the product shown

${revisionContext ? `**USER FEEDBACK ON CURRENT COPY:**
${revisionContext}

Factor this feedback into your alternatives.` : ""}

## OUTPUT FORMAT

### Current Copy Analysis
[Identify current copy for each zone and briefly note what works/doesn't work]

### Variation 2

`).join("")}

### Variation 3
${adFormat.specs.copyPlacements.map((p: { zone: string }) => `
**${p.zone.toUpperCase()}:** "[Your copy]"
`).join("")}

CRITICAL: Follow the patterns in the format guidelines. If a zone says "Pattern: '[Thing A] Meets [Thing B]'" - use that exact structure.` : `

To use Revise Copy, you must select an existing ad format. This allows the AI to apply trained copy patterns specific to that format.

Please go back and select the format this ad uses.`}` : metaAdType === "static-creative" ? `
Generate copy for a STATIC CREATIVE (image ad with text overlays).

${adFormat ? `## AD FORMAT: ${adFormat.name}

This ad uses a specific format with defined copy zones. Generate copy for EACH zone below.

**CRITICAL: You MUST respect the character limits. Count your characters. If your copy exceeds the limit, rewrite it shorter.**

Best for: ${adFormat.specs.bestFor.join(", ")}

## OUTPUT FORMAT
For each zone defined above, output in this exact format:

[ZONE-NAME]

**IMPORTANT:**
- Count characters for each zone before outputting
- If copy is too long, rewrite it shorter - do not exceed limits
- Character limits exist because designers need copy that fits the visual layout
- Shorter, punchier copy is almost always better
- For any LIST zones (like benefits-list), output EACH ITEM on its own line:
  1. First item
  2. Second item
  3. Third item

1. Analyze the layout and identify ALL text placement zones (headline, subhead, body text, CTA button, badges, etc.)
