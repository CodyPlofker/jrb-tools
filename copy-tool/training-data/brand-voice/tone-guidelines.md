# Jones Road Brand Voice Guidelines

## Core Philosophy

Jones Road sounds like a confident, stylish friend who respects your time and intelligence. She tells you what something is, why it's good, and moves on. No overselling. No anxiety. No trying too hard.

**The brand promise in one phrase:** "Polished without the effort."

## Voice Characteristics

### Confident but Not Pushy
- Declarative statements, not hedging
- "This is a friggin miracle" not "We think you might like this"
- Expert authority without lecturing

### Effortless is the Goal
- "Effortless" appears repeatedly - it's core to the brand
- Anti-complexity positioning
- Permission to do less, better

### Inclusive Without Pandering
- Speaks to all ages without calling out age
- "Makes fair women look like they have the perfect pink blush on. And makes darker skin women have the perfect little highlight."
- No fear tactics or shame about aging

### Practical Luxury
- Elevated but accessible
- "Intentional" not "carefully crafted"
- Quality without pretense

## Voice Registers

Jones Road has different tones for different contexts, but all share the core characteristics above.

### Product Copy (Most Elevated)
- Polished, intentional, luxurious
- Heritage-conscious
- Sensory but restrained

**Example:** "The Body Collection transforms your existing everyday rituals, making them more luxurious. Each formula is enriched with ceramides and other deeply nourishing ingredients to comfort dryness, restore softness, and support overall skin health."

### Email Copy (Encouraging)
- Warm, permission-giving
- Small upgrades, big impact
- "Me-time" and "feel-good" language

**Example:** "A new year doesn't need to mean a full overhaul. Just a fresh start — and a routine that works for you."

### Meta Ads (Punchy & Relatable)
- Problem-first hooks
- Light humor, self-aware
- "For real life" energy

**Example:** "Forget 12 steps. The Hero Kit is your all-in-one set for real life: cover, glow, and a touch of color. Just enough to feel like you."

### Bobbi Direct (Warm Expert)
- First person, casual
- "Genius in a pot"
- Personal recommendations like a friend

**Example:** "I've been looking for a product like this my whole life. It doesn't require a lot of skill, it doesn't require a lot of time. And honestly, this is THE REASON I started Jones Road."

2. "Why We Love It" = emotional benefit
3. "How It's Different" = rational justification
4. Bobbi's Tip (when applicable)

### Ad Copy
1. Hook: Call out frustration OR state benefit plainly
2. Position against: Complexity, heavy makeup, too many steps
3. Promise: Easy, natural, "feel like you but better"
4. Proof: Social proof, reviews, results

## What Jones Road Copy NEVER Does
- Promises transformation or a "new you"
- Uses fear/shame about aging
- Overwhelms with ingredients or science
- Sounds like every other beauty brand
- Creates anxiety or pressure
- Talks down to the customer
