### The Bobbi Kit 5.0
To celebrate five years of Jones Road, The Bobbi Kit 5.0 is here with five exclusives for a laid-back, statement look. It features the not-yet-released Eyeshadow Stick, a creamy, long-lasting eyeshadow that glides on effortlessly. As a nod to Jones Road's early days, each kit also includes The Lip in Batch 18 in its original shade and packaging. Lastly, we've included new shades of The Illuminator, Mini Miracle Balm, and The Best Pencil to round out your statement. Select from two colorways: Chic or Cheeky.

**Why We Love It:**
Classic, versatile, and universally flattering, these are Bobbi's must-haves of the season for feeling polished without the effort. The Bobbi Kit 5.0 creates a laid-back, statement look by pairing brand new favorites with fresh takes on the effortless staples you love.

**How It's Different:**
This is the first Bobbi Kit to offer five fully exclusive products that are versatile enough to be dressed up or down. It features a first look at a new effortless product, The Eyeshadow Stick, as well as The Lip in Batch 18 — the tinted lip balm that inspired Bobbi to launch Jones Road. We've also brought back the highly requested Illuminator in two new shades, along with exclusive shades of Mini Miracle Balm and The Best Pencil.

### The Body Collection
Do more with the time you have. The Body Collection transforms your existing everyday rituals, making them more luxurious. The collection consists of five intentional formulas — Body Cream, Body Lotion, Body Oil, Body Scrub, and Shower Gel. Each is enriched with ceramides and other deeply nourishing ingredients to comfort dryness, restore softness, and support overall skin health. Lightly scented with citrusy and floral notes, this clean collection turns everyday body care into something more.

## Bobbi's Voice Examples

### Bobbi's Tip (Product Page)
Genius in a pot. Once you break the seal of the balm, you can wear it alone, or use it to bronze, highlight, or tint the skin by mixing and matching shades.

### Bobbi on The Kit
"This kit has everything I love — classic tones, versatile products, plus a few new surprises. And it's even more special because it includes The Lip in Batch 18, the lip that inspired me to start Jones Road. Five years later, it's still one of my favorites."

### Bobbi Video Transcript (Miracle Balm)
"I've been looking for a product like this my whole life. And wear this product every day. We're all putting it on, looking in the mirror and we're like oh my god. This is a friggin miracle.

Every morning when I wake up, put on my dusty rose, feel this natural glow and ready for my day.

Here's the color breakdown: Au Naturel has no color. Use all the time. It has luminosity just from moisture content. Is tiny. Really cuts yellow in skin.

Dusty rose. Such beautiful color. Really does enhance a lot of skin tones. Makes fair women look like they have the perfect pink blush on. And makes darker skin women have the perfect little highlight.

Magic Hour has become my new go-to. I always have one in my bag. When you really want just some luminosity, you want a little bit of highlight, a little bit to shine. I put this on and I'm like okay, look better.

So love Miracle Balm. It doesn't require a lot of skill. It doesn't require a lot of time. And honestly, this is THE REASON I started Jones Road."
