# Animation Principles for Advertising

## Core Principles

### 1. Attention & Hierarchy
- **First 3 seconds are critical** - This is where you capture or lose the viewer
- Lead with your strongest visual element or most compelling message
- Create a clear visual hierarchy: background → main visual → text → CTA
- Use motion to guide the eye to key elements in sequence

### 2. Pacing & Rhythm
- **Fast start, compelling middle, strong finish**
- Match animation speed to message urgency
- Use pauses (holds) to let important messages sink in
- Vary the rhythm - constant motion becomes monotonous

### 3. Less is More
- Avoid animating everything at once
- Each animation should serve a purpose
- Simple, clean transitions outperform complex effects
- One focal point at a time

### 4. Brand Consistency
- Animation style should match brand personality
- Luxury brands: slower, more elegant transitions
- Youth/energy brands: faster, more dynamic movements
- Maintain consistent timing and easing across the piece

## Animation Timing Guidelines

### Entry Animations
| Element Type | Duration | Delay Pattern |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Background | 0.3-0.5s | 0s (first) |
| Main Image | 0.5-0.8s | 0.2-0.3s after bg |
| Headline | 0.4-0.6s | After main visual settles |
| Subtext | 0.3-0.5s | 0.2s after headline |
| CTA | 0.5-0.7s | Last element, with emphasis |

### Easing Functions
- **ease-out**: Best for entries - starts fast, ends smooth
- **ease-in**: Best for exits - starts smooth, ends fast
- **ease-in-out**: Best for transformations within view
- **linear**: Rarely use - feels mechanical

### Hold Times
- Headlines: 2-3 seconds minimum for reading
- Subtext: 1.5-2 seconds
- CTA: 2-4 seconds (longer at end)

## Animation Types & When to Use

### Fade
- **Best for**: Backgrounds, overlays, subtle reveals
- **Avoid**: When you need to grab attention
- **Duration**: 0.3-0.8s

### Slide (Up/Down/Left/Right)
- **Best for**: Text entries, sequential reveals
- **Slide Up**: Positive, ascending messaging
- **Slide Left**: Natural reading direction, "next" feeling
- **Duration**: 0.4-0.7s

### Zoom In/Out
- **Zoom In**: Focus attention, highlight importance
- **Zoom Out**: Reveal context, establish scene
- **Best for**: Hero products, before/after reveals
- **Duration**: 0.5-1.0s

### Bounce
- **Best for**: Playful brands, CTAs, discount numbers
- **Avoid**: Luxury brands, serious messaging
- **Duration**: 0.6-1.0s

### Pulse
- **Best for**: Drawing attention to CTA, urgency
- **Use sparingly**: Can feel aggressive
- **Duration**: 0.3-0.5s per pulse

## Transitions Between Scenes

### Crossfade
- Most professional, least distracting
- Works for any content type
- Duration: 0.5-1.0s

### Wipe/Slide
- Creates sense of progression
- Good for before/after reveals
- Direction should match reading pattern

### Zoom
- High impact, use for major reveals
- Zoom out to reveal, zoom in to focus
- Can feel disorienting if overused

## Mobile-First Considerations

- Text must be readable at small sizes (min 14pt on mobile)
- Tap targets for CTAs should be clearly visible
- Avoid tiny animated elements that get lost
- Vertical formats (9:16) should stack elements vertically
- Horizontal formats need quick eye travel left-to-right

## Sound Design Alignment

If using audio:
- Sync major transitions to beat/rhythm
- Text reveals on downbeats
- Build to CTA with audio crescendo
- Fade out audio at end, don't abrupt cut
