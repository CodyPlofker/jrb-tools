# AppLovin Animated Ads Best Practices

## Platform Overview

AppLovin is a mobile advertising platform focused on in-app advertising. Ads appear as interstitials, rewarded videos, banners, and native placements within mobile games and apps. The key is creating high-impact, full-screen experiences that convert.

## Core Principles for AppLovin

### 1. Full-Screen Impact
- Ads take over the entire screen (interstitial/rewarded)
- No competing content - you have full attention
- Make every pixel count
- Bold visuals and clear messaging

### 2. Quick Hook, Clear Value
- Users are interrupted from their app experience
- Respect their time with immediate value proposition
- Get to the point in first 3 seconds
- Make the benefit crystal clear

### 3. Strong Call-to-Action
- Every ad should have a clear next step
- "Install Now", "Download Free", "Shop Now"
- CTA should be unmissable
- Consider animated/pulsing CTAs

### 4. Mobile-Native Feel
- Design for touch interfaces
- Buttons should look tappable
- Avoid tiny text or cluttered layouts
- High contrast for outdoor/varied lighting

## Format-Specific Guidelines

### Interstitial (9:16 Portrait)
- **Dimensions:** 1080x1920
- **Duration:** 15-30 seconds
- **Skip behavior:** Often non-skippable or skip after 5s
- **Goal:** Brand awareness + conversion

**Animation Approach:**
- Strong opening hook (0-2s)
- Product/benefit showcase (2-12s)
- Clear CTA reveal (12-15s)
- CTA holds until ad ends
- Consider loop if duration allows

**Key Considerations:**
- Full-screen real estate - use it boldly
- No competing UI elements
- CTA placement: center-bottom third
- Include close button consideration space (top corners)

### Banner - Large (728x90)
- **Dimensions:** 728x90
- **Duration:** 6-15 seconds (looping)
- **Position:** Typically top or bottom of screen
- **Goal:** Brand recall + click-through

**Animation Approach:**
- Extremely concise messaging (3-5 words max)
- Simple, looping animation
- Product/logo always visible
- CTA integrated into design

**Key Considerations:**
- Very limited space - prioritize ruthlessly
- Animation should be subtle, not distracting
- Logo and CTA should never fully disappear
- Must work at smaller sizes

### Banner - Small (320x50)
- **Dimensions:** 320x50
- **Duration:** 6-15 seconds (looping)
- **Position:** Typically bottom of screen
- **Goal:** Persistent brand presence + click-through

**Animation Approach:**
- Even more minimal than large banner
- 1-3 words maximum at any time
- Logo or product always present
- Subtle animation to catch eye without annoying

**Key Considerations:**
- Extremely limited real estate
- Must be readable while small
- Users glance, don't stare
- Don't compete with app content too aggressively

### Rewarded Video (9:16 Portrait)
- **Dimensions:** 1080x1920
- **Duration:** 15-30 seconds
- **Skip behavior:** Users choose to watch for reward
- **Goal:** High engagement + brand affinity

**Animation Approach:**
- Can be slightly longer-form storytelling
- Users are more patient (they chose to watch)
- Still hook early, but can develop message
- Reward the viewer's attention with value
- Strong CTA with clear benefit

**Key Considerations:**
- Higher completion rates than interstitial
- Users are more receptive
- Can include more detail/features
- End with memorable brand moment

### Native (1.91:1 Landscape)
- **Dimensions:** 1200x627
- **Duration:** 6-15 seconds
- **Position:** Within content feed
- **Goal:** Blend + engage + convert

**Animation Approach:**
- Should feel like content, not ad
- Subtle animation preferred
- Product-focused visuals
- Clear but not aggressive CTA

**Key Considerations:**
- Competes with organic content
- Must earn attention, not demand it
- Native feel is critical
- Consider content context

## Animation Techniques for AppLovin

### High-Performing Patterns

1. **The Power Open**
   - Bold text or image in first frame
   - Immediate motion
   - Sound effect if audio enabled
   - "Stop and look" moment

2. **The Product Showcase**
   - Product enters dynamically
   - 360° rotation or angle shifts
   - Feature callouts animate in
   - Ends on clear product shot with CTA

3. **The Problem-Solution**
   - Quick problem visualization (1-2s)
   - Transition to solution
   - Product as hero
   - CTA with value proposition

4. **The Countdown/Timer**
   - Creates urgency
   - Numbers animating down
   - "Limited time" messaging
   - Works well for offers/sales

5. **The Demo**
   - Show product in use
   - Before/after transformation
   - Step-by-step with text callouts
   - Ends with CTA to try it

### Transitions to Use
- **Cut:** Quick, energetic
- **Slide:** Clean, professional
- **Zoom:** Focus attention
- **Pop:** Playful, engaging

### Transitions to Avoid
- Slow fades (lose attention)
- Complex 3D transitions
- Excessive particle effects
- Anything that feels "dated"

## Text & Typography

### Headlines
- Maximum 5 words ideal
- Bold, high-contrast
- Sans-serif for readability
- Appear in first 2 seconds

### Body Copy
- 1-2 short sentences max
- Bullet points if listing features
- Progressive reveal works well
- Never crowd the screen

### CTA Text
- 2-3 words ("Get It Free", "Install Now")
- Button format recommended
- High contrast with background
- Large enough to tap (min 44pt)

## Color & Visual Guidelines

### Colors
- Bright, saturated colors perform well
- High contrast is essential
- Consider dark backgrounds for impact
- Brand colors should be present

### Visual Style
- Clean, uncluttered layouts
- One focal point at a time
- Professional but not corporate
- Mobile-appropriate imagery

## Sound & Audio

### When Audio is Enabled
- Start with impactful sound
- Music should match energy of ad
- Voice-over should be clear and concise
- End with audio brand signature if possible

### Always Design Sound-Off First
- Core message must work silently
- Text overlays for all key points
- Visual storytelling is primary
- Audio enhances, not required

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Slow, boring openings** - Lost attention immediately
2. **Too much information** - Overwhelming the viewer
3. **Weak or missing CTA** - No conversion pathway
4. **Poor contrast/readability** - Message not received
5. **Ignoring format constraints** - Content cut off
6. **Generic stock content** - Forgettable
7. **No brand presence** - Zero recall
8. **Aggressive/annoying animation** - Negative association
