# Meta Animated Ads Best Practices

## Platform Overview

Meta (Facebook/Instagram) animated ads need to work across Feed, Stories, and Reels placements. The key is creating thumb-stopping content that captures attention in a scroll-heavy environment.

## Core Principles for Meta

### 1. Capture Attention in 0-3 Seconds
- First frame must be compelling even as a still
- Movement should begin immediately
- Lead with your strongest visual or boldest claim
- Avoid slow fades or builds at the start

### 2. Sound-Off First Design
- 85% of Meta video is watched without sound
- All important information must be visible as text
- Use captions/subtitles for any spoken content
- Sound should enhance, not be required

### 3. Mobile-First Dimensions
- Design for vertical (9:16) and square (1:1) first
- Text should be readable at phone size
- Minimum 24pt font equivalent for headlines
- High contrast between text and background

### 4. Native Feel
- Match the organic content style of each placement
- Stories/Reels: more casual, authentic feel
- Feed: can be more polished but not overly corporate
- Avoid feeling like a traditional "TV commercial"

## Format-Specific Guidelines

### Feed (4:5)
- **Dimensions:** 1080x1350
- **Duration:** 15 seconds optimal (max 60s, but engagement drops after 15s)
- **Safe zones:** Keep key content away from edges (5% margin)
- **Caption overlay:** Plan for text to appear below video
- **Animation style:** Polished but not overly produced

**Animation Approach:**
- Immediate visual hook (0-0.5s)
- Core message delivered by 3s
- Supporting content 3-10s
- Strong CTA at end with hold time

### Stories (9:16)
- **Dimensions:** 1080x1920
- **Duration:** 15 seconds maximum
- **Safe zones:** Top 250px and bottom 250px are risky (UI overlays)
- **Tap-through consideration:** Design for quick consumption
- **Interactive feel:** Can feel more personal/direct

**Animation Approach:**
- Start with motion (no static opening)
- Vertical text stacking works well
- Quick cuts between messages
- CTA should include swipe-up visual cue

### Reels (9:16)
- **Dimensions:** 1080x1920
- **Duration:** 15-30 seconds optimal (can go up to 60s)
- **Native style:** Should feel like creator content, not ads
- **Trend-aware:** Can incorporate trending formats/transitions
- **Engagement-focused:** Designed for watch-through

**Animation Approach:**
- Hook-driven opening (problem/question/bold statement)
- Fast-paced editing acceptable
- Text should appear with motion
- End with clear CTA + reason to act

### Square (1:1)
- **Dimensions:** 1080x1080
- **Duration:** 15 seconds optimal
- **Universal placement:** Works in feed, right column, etc.
- **Balanced composition:** Center-focused design

**Animation Approach:**
- Central focal point
- Symmetric or balanced layouts work well
- Text can frame the visual (top and bottom)
- Good for product-focused content

## Animation Techniques That Work on Meta

### High-Performing Patterns
1. **The Thumb-Stop**
   - Unexpected movement in first frame
   - High contrast color flash
   - Human face/eye contact
   - Text that asks a question

2. **The Reveal**
   - Start with problem → reveal solution
   - Before/after with wipe transition
   - Unboxing or unwrapping motion
   - Zoom out from detail to full product

3. **The Scroll-Stop Text**
   - Bold text that slides in aggressively
   - Counter or number animation (counting up/down)
   - Text that transforms (strikethrough → new text)
   - Split-second text flashes

4. **The Product Hero**
   - Product rotates or moves into frame
   - Ingredients/benefits floating around product
   - Scale shift (small to large or vice versa)
   - Product in use → product alone

### Transitions to Use
- **Quick cuts:** Keep energy high
- **Slide transitions:** Feel native to platform
- **Zoom:** For product focus moments
- **Crossfade:** For softer brand moments

### Transitions to Avoid
- Overly complex 3D transitions
- Slow dissolves (feel dated)
- Wipes that feel like PowerPoint
- Flash transitions (can trigger seizure warnings)

## Text & Typography

### Headlines
- Max 5-7 words
- Appears within first 2 seconds
- High contrast with background
- Sans-serif fonts preferred for readability

### Body Copy
- Short, punchy sentences
- Bullet points work well
- Progressive reveal (one point at a time)
- Don't crowd the screen

### CTA Text
- Action-oriented ("Shop Now", "Learn More", "Get Yours")
- Include urgency when applicable
- Consider showing price/discount
- CTA should be visible for 2-3 seconds minimum

## Color & Contrast

- Bright, saturated colors perform well
- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text
- Use brand colors but don't be afraid to be bold
- Dark mode consideration: test on dark backgrounds

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Slow starts** - Losing viewer in first second
2. **Too much text** - Overwhelming the viewer
3. **Small text** - Unreadable on mobile
4. **No CTA** - Missing the conversion opportunity
5. **Sound-dependent** - Losing the muted audience
6. **Wrong aspect ratio** - Content gets cropped
7. **Ignoring safe zones** - UI covers key content
8. **Generic stock feel** - Blending into ad fatigue

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Does first frame work as a still image?
- [ ] Is the hook delivered in 0-3 seconds?
- [ ] Can I understand the message with sound off?
- [ ] Is all text readable on a phone?
- [ ] Is there a clear CTA?
