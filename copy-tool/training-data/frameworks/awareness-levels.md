## The Five Stages of Awareness

### 1. Unaware
**Description:** They don't know they have a problem yet.

**How to Reach Them:**
- Lead with story, intrigue, or identity — not product
- Make them feel seen before pitching
- Use pattern interrupts and curiosity

**Jones Road Example:**
"You're not lazy for hating your makeup routine. You just haven't found one that respects your time."

**Copy Focus:** Identity, story, curiosity

---

### 2. Problem Aware
**Description:** They know they have a problem but don't know solutions exist.

**How to Reach Them:**
- Agitate the problem — make them feel it
- Then introduce the solution category
- Don't pitch your product yet, pitch the approach

**Jones Road Example:**
"Tired of foundation making you look older? There's a reason for that. Heavy makeup settles into fine lines and emphasizes texture. The solution isn't more coverage — it's a different approach entirely."

**Copy Focus:** Problem agitation, education, solution category

---

### 3. Solution Aware
**Description:** They know solutions exist but don't know YOUR product.

**How to Reach Them:**
- Differentiate your approach
- Explain WHY your solution works differently
- Introduce the unique mechanism

**Jones Road Example:**
"You've tried 'natural' makeup before. But most 'clean' brands sacrifice performance. Jones Road is different: clean ingredients that actually work, created by the woman who revolutionized natural makeup."

**Copy Focus:** Differentiation, unique mechanism, why THIS works

---

### 4. Product Aware
**Description:** They know your product but aren't convinced yet.

**How to Reach Them:**
- Proof, testimonials, overcome objections
- Address specific concerns
- Show results

**Jones Road Example:**
"29,931 five-star reviews. 'The amount of compliments I receive when I have this on is unbelievable.'"

**Copy Focus:** Social proof, testimonials, objection handling

---

### 5. Most Aware
**Description:** They know and want it, just need a reason to act NOW.

**How to Reach Them:**
- Make an offer
- Create urgency (authentic, not fake)
- Remind them why they wanted it

**Jones Road Example:**
"The Bobbi Kit 5.0 is back — with five exclusives. Once it's gone, it's gone."

**Copy Focus:** Offer, urgency, reminder of desire

---

## How to Use This Framework

### For Meta Ads (Cold Traffic)
Most prospects are **Problem Aware** or **Solution Aware**. Lead with the problem or differentiation, not the product name.

### For Email (Warm Traffic)
Most subscribers are **Product Aware** or **Most Aware**. Focus on proof, new reasons to believe, and offers.

### For Retargeting
They're **Product Aware** — they've seen it. Give them proof, overcome objections, or make an offer.

## Jones Road's Market Position

The beauty market is saturated (Level 5 sophistication), so most prospects have tried "solutions" before and been disappointed.

**Key insight:** Don't just claim "clean" or "natural" — everyone does. Explain WHY Jones Road's approach is different (the unique mechanism) and connect emotionally with WHO they are (identification).
