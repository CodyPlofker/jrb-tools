# Hook Principles

What makes a hook work. This document captures the core principles that separate great hooks from mediocre ones.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Curiosity Gap
Create a gap between what the viewer knows and what they want to know. The hook promises information that satisfies an itch.

### 2. Open Loops
Start something that demands completion. The brain naturally wants to close loops - use this to keep viewers watching.

### 3. Pattern Interrupt
Break expectations. Say something unexpected that makes the viewer stop scrolling and pay attention.

### 4. Specificity
Vague hooks feel generic. Specific details (numbers, names, scenarios) feel real and credible.

### 5. Emotional Trigger
Tap into a feeling: frustration, desire, fear of missing out, validation, surprise.

### 6. Implied Transformation
Suggest that watching will change something for the viewer - they'll learn, feel, or gain something.

## What to Avoid

- Starting slow or with unnecessary context
- Being predictable
- Overselling or clickbait that doesn't deliver
- Generic statements that could apply to anything
- Burying the interesting part

## Channel Considerations

### Paid Ads
- Must work without sound (first frame matters)
- Viewer is interrupting their feed - earn attention fast
- Can be more direct about product/benefit

### Organic
- Feels native to platform
- Often more conversational/authentic
- Can build more slowly if pattern interrupt is strong

### Brand POV vs Creator POV
- **Brand**: Can lean on authority, product knowledge, behind-the-scenes
- **Creator**: Personal story, discovery narrative, "I found this thing"

## Sources & Trainings

### Sarah Levinger - Hook Frameworks & Ingredients

#### Four Core Hook Types

1. **"That's me" recognition (Identity Signaling)**
   - Make the viewer feel seen in 1 sentence by calling out something only they would know.

2. **"Wait… what?" (Expectation Violation)**
   - Break their prediction loop by starting normal, ending weird.

3. **"I need to know if I'm doing this wrong" (Fear of Avoidable Loss)**
   - Go for avoidable pain, not doom and gloom: wasted money, wasted time, wasted effort.

4. **"Show me" (Evidence + Specificity)**
   - Receipts will always beat something cute, and the more receipts you bring, the faster they click.

#### 50 Hook Ingredients That Outperform Templates

**Specificity & Objects**
1. A hyper-specific object: "a silicone spatula" / "a cracked iPhone charger"
5. One oddly precise number: 17%, 11 days, 43 minutes
13. A specific villain: "the dropdown menu," "the group chat," "the hand soap pump"
20. A tiny sensory detail: "the wet sleeve," "the sticky lid," "the squeaky sneaker"
34. A single screenshot you can point to

**Confessions & Vulnerability**
2. A tiny confession: "I keep doing this even though I know it's dumb"
9. A "before you judge me…" preface
15. A bad idea you tried so they don't have to
19. A mistake you made that cost money (and the receipt)
27. A confession of uncertainty… followed by proof
28. A "this is embarrassing but useful" setup

**Pattern Breaks & Surprises**
3. A "wrong on purpose" statement (that you immediately explain)
4. A rule you broke and lived to tell the tale
10. A comparison nobody expects: "This works like airport security"
11. A sentence that starts mid-thought: "—and that's when it got expensive."
14. A taboo-adjacent truth (safe, but spicy)
25. An instruction that feels illegal: "Do less targeting. Seriously."
35. A "the opposite is true" statement

**Emotional & Identity**
7. A surprisingly emotional word in a logical sentence ("relief," "shame," "weirdly proud")
8. A "this is for one type of person" callout
12. A mild insult aimed at the problem, not the person
16. A "you're not lazy, it's X" reframe
17. A name for the moment right before someone quits
23. A weirdly relatable fear: "checking your bank app after ads refresh"
42. A "nobody is immune to this" human truth

**Reveals & Truths**
18. A "nobody tells you this part" line (only if you deliver)
21. A one-sentence myth-bust
22. The "unsexy middle" (what actually happened between A and B)
24. A "here's what I expected vs what happened" split
36. A "I thought this was a flex… it was a warning" line
37. A "here's the sentence customers actually respond to" reveal

**Metaphors & Analogies**
30. A metaphor from home life: laundry, dishes, toys, fridge
31. A metaphor from biology: metabolism, pain signals, reflexes
32. A metaphor from animals: "raccoon logic," "goldfish memory"
43. A physical analogy for cognitive load

**Structure & Format**
6. A boring task described like a thriller
29. A "my favorite thing about this is the boring part" line
33. A pattern you noticed after looking at way too many examples
38. A micro-case study in 3 lines
40. A familiar phrase upgraded by one sharper word

**Warnings & Advice**
26. A "stop optimizing the symptom" line
39. A "I'm begging you not to do this" line (only if it's real)
41. A "this sounds petty but it matters" setup
44. A "you don't need more creatives, you need fewer decisions" line
45. A "here's what I'd do if I had to start over tomorrow" line
46. A "3 signs you're about to waste X" list
47. A "this is why your X test lied to you" line
48. A "the best hook is the first accurate sentence" line
49. A "write this down" one-liner
50. A closing punch that makes the reader feel smarter (not scolded)
