## Just Enough Tinted Moisturizer - Porcelain

### ★★★★★ - A Great Moisturizer
I love it!! It’s a wonderful moisturizer with just a touch of color!  Sheer enough that you can still see my freckles!  A terrific product!

## Lip and Cheek Stick - Mauve Rose

### ★★★★★ - Love it
Love it

## Mini Eye Cream - Eye Cream

### ★★★★★ - Good product and it works!
Fragrance free! I do not like feeling like I am putting perfumed products on my face. That can be irritating. This is not greasy, absorbs quickly, and leave my under eyes moist and ready to apply the face pencils.

## Mini What The Foundation - Porcelain

### ★★★★★ - Just right!
I was a little worried when I read the reviews that said that this product was greasy and separated.  My experience was much different. This makeup applies easily, has just the right amount of coverage, and looks moist and natural (NOT greasy) throughout the day. I have recommended it to several friends and they have been happy with it also. When I wear makeup, this is the one!

## Miracle Balm - Au Naturel

Average. Does not work on the water line.

## The Best Pencil - Brown

I love the mascara and eye liner! The two colors of miracle balm work well with my skin tone. I haven’t used the eye cream consistently yet.

## The Lippie Stick - Me

### ★★★★☆ - Good product.
I like the color and the container.   I got the "Me" shade.  It feels a bit sticky going on but other than that, great product.

## The Mascara - Pitch Black

### ★★★★☆ - Overall I do like...
Overall I do like the mascara but it can get clumpy

### ★★★★★ - Great product
First time buyer for all things Jones Road.  The mascara is a favorite, it goes on well, the wand has a good shape.  No clumps on my lashes.  It stays on all day and comes off easily with makeup remover.  I do use my index finger to push the lashes up a bit after applying and that works very well.

### ★★★★★ - One of the best...
One of the best mascaras I have used. I will continue to buy this.

## The Mini Fragrance Trio - The Mini Fragrance Trio

### ★★★★☆ - Loved trying all the scents and found my favorite!
Loved Shower and liked BKLYN. The evening fragrance, En Route, had a smell that I recognize but could not place.  It is just not to my personal taste. However, I enjoyed trying them all and added the Shower gel and the full size Shower fragrance to my collection.

## The Mini Lip Kit - Mauve

### ★★★★★ - Liked it. Shade was...
Liked it. Shade was good . Like all 3 together

## The Mini Miracle Balm Trio - The Mini Miracle Balm Trio

### ★★★★★ - I was very pleased...
I was very pleased with it. Thank you

### ★★★★★ - Please, Please keep Après and Party Miracle Balm colors!
Please, please keep Après and Party in your permanent Miracle Balm collection!!!    Après is perfect for me. It matches the color of my lips and gives me a natural 'no makeup' glow under any circumstances. Party looks natural, but better. My favorites had been Miami Beach and Au Naturel, with Golden Hour for evenings. Party is like Miami Beach - light, perfect for most skin tones. It works like magic on my yellow-based skin, as does Après.  The Noir was a lovely surprise. My skin is very pale (okay, sallow sometimes), but Noir looked like a natural flush, like coming in from a frosty day.  Ballerina rounded out the trio. While I like the golden tone of Golden Hour, this worked well as a highlighter for the evening and was an even more subtle glow.

## The Neutralizer Pencil - Fair Pink

### ★★★★★ - This Neutralizer Pencil exceeded my expectations. I bought another one for my travel kit. It works!
I did not know if a pink concealer was going to help with my  under eye darkness.  My skin has yellow undertones, so pink would not be a natural choice for me. Wrong! This pencil does exactly what it is supposed to do - camouflage the dark circles and brighten the eye area. I use it under my eye pencil for days without foundation and I can use it directly under my WTF. I do not even need to blend it that way because applying the foundation blends it perfectly for a wide awake, natural look.

### ★★★★★ - This gives me great...
This gives me great coverage under my eyes where there is purple coming through my skin.  It doesnt crease and doesnt make my eyes look weird

## The Oil Stick - The Oil Stick

### ★★★★★ - Does its intended job!
I put this in dry areas on my face prior to applying my foundation.

## The Party Kit - Party

### ★★★★★ - Love the Party Miracle Balm. It is perfect.
Loved the Party Miracle Balm and would love to buy it in the full size! I enjoyed using the espresso gel liner and have put it in rotation. It looks natural and lasts longer than the eye pencils with no 'racoon eyes' by mid-day.  The eye-shadow stick in cool taupe was not for me, only because I am a bit too old for a shimmery eye. The texture is lovely and it goes on smoothly. Just not a fan of the color.

## The Sharpener - The Sharpener

### ★★★★★ - easy to use and...
easy to use and compace

## What The Foundation - Beige

### ★★★★★ - Love this! Perfect color, great glow!
LOVE this! Perfect color, great glow!

## What The Foundation - Ivory

### ★★★★☆ - Less coverage than expected.
So far I like how moisturizing it is, especially for winters in Alaska. Coverage is lighter than I expected and the scent is a little strong. I have the ivory and I think it's a little light.

### ★★★☆☆ - Shows in lines and...
Shows in lines and wrinkles

### ★★★★★ - Amazing!
Amazing! So lightweight and just enough coverage.

### ★☆☆☆☆ - Disappointed
This was very disappointing. It smells so bad. And the coverage is very cakey. It looks oily and thick somehow at the same time. Coverage is not there. Ugh. The smell

## What The Foundation - Light

### ★★★★★ - Best light weight foundation for skin in your 50s.
I’m in my 50’s and this  foundation made my skin look glowy and radiant.  It is one of the best products I’ve found.  Thank you Jones Road!

## What The Foundation - Medium Honey

### ★★★★★ - Look of it!
Look of it!

### ★★★★★ - Giving it time, patience & varied application, you will be happy with it. I am! Have received many compliments about how wonderful my skin looks.
This is my 2nd WTF. Patiently and giving it 2 months, I ordered a 2nd one slightly darker. I am really liking it. I feel my skin has acclimated to texture. I was initially struggling w stickiness & heaviness. I changed how I applied it using combination makeup spatula, finger dabbing and brush. That did the trick. I am so glad I was patient. Bobbi Brown has never let me down before. I am hopeful for some discount codes w usage.

## What The Foundation - Pecan

### ★★★★★ - Love the pecan! ...
Love the pecan!  The pecan blends really well.  I could have gone a shade lighter but I like looking like I spent the weekend at the beach.  Once you blend it, it's so nice and clean.  I love all of the products at Jones Road.

## What The Foundation - Porcelain

### ★★★★★ - Finally a foundation I can get behind!
I've been on the find the right foundation rollercoaster for a very very long time and I didn't hold a lot of hope for this one. I'm so glad I was wrong. This isn't a full coverage but it hides my dark sun damage spots well. It is very moisturizing. The first time I used it I thought maybe it was too moisturizing but my face feels fabulous all day and looks beautifully dewy. At 46 Ive finally found my everyday foundation! It stays even all day and doesn't separate. I do use a little powder on my t zones when I'm doing an evening look. Pair it with some miracle balm and you can't go wrong!
