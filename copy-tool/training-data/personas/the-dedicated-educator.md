## Identity Snapshot

The woman who shapes the next generation. She's the teacher who stays late to help struggling students, the professor who genuinely cares about office hours, the administrator who remembers every student's name. Teaching isn't just her job — it's her calling. But that calling comes with early alarms, endless grading, and the constant emotional labor of being "on" for others all day long.

## Psychographics: Who She Really Is

### Core Identity Traits
- **The Giver**: Her life is oriented around service to others — students, colleagues, community
- **The Early Riser**: 5:30am alarms are non-negotiable; mornings are a race against the clock
- **The Perpetual Preparer**: Always thinking about tomorrow's lesson, next week's parent conference
- **The Underappreciated Expert**: Highly educated, deeply skilled, but often undervalued by society

### Values
1. **Substance over style** — Authenticity matters more than appearance
2. **Durability and reliability** — Products must work as hard as she does
3. **Value for investment** — Stretches every dollar, appreciates quality that lasts
4. **Approachability** — Wants to seem accessible to students and parents alike

### Worldview
She believes education changes lives and chose this path despite knowing it wouldn't make her rich. She's proud of her work but exhausted by the lack of resources, respect, and time. She's practical by necessity and skeptical of anything that seems frivolous or high-maintenance.

## The Emotional Landscape

### Fears
- Looking unprofessional in front of students, parents, or administrators
- Makeup that draws attention or looks "too much" for a classroom
- Being perceived as vain when her focus should be on students
- Products failing mid-day with no time to fix them

### Desires
- To look polished and put-together without effort
- A routine that respects her 5am wake-up call
- Products that last from first bell to last — no touch-ups needed
- To feel like herself, not invisible

### Frustrations
- Makeup tutorials assume 30 minutes; she has 5
- Products that look great at 7am but disappear by lunch
- Can't touch up during the day — always in front of an audience
- Exhaustion shows on her face by 3pm

### Daily Wins
- A student saying "you look nice today, Ms. [Name]"
- Making it through parent-teacher conferences looking fresh
- A colleague asking what products she uses

## The Burnout Reality

### The Statistics
- **44% of K-12 teachers** report feeling burned out "often" or "always"
- **77% of teachers** indicate they frequently experience job-related stress
- **78% have considered quitting** since the pandemic
- Over **70% take on extra work** due to staff shortages

### What Burnout Looks Like for Her
- Emotional exhaustion from being "on" all day
- Feeling undervalued despite advanced degrees
- Guilt about not doing enough — for students, family, herself
- Physical fatigue that shows on her face

### Self-Care vs. System Change
She's heard "practice self-care" but knows that's not the whole answer. As one educator put it: "You can't yoga yourself out of burnout." What she needs is solutions that work within her constraints, not advice to change her life.
