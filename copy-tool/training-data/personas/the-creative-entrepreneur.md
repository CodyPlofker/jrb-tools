## Identity Snapshot

The woman who creates for a living. She's a graphic designer, photographer, interior decorator, small business owner, or artist — someone who sees beauty in intention, craftsmanship, and authenticity. Her aesthetic sensibility extends to everything she touches, including her makeup. She doesn't follow trends; she curates. She wants products that align with her values: minimal waste, maximum impact, designed with purpose.

## Psychographics: Who She Really Is

### Core Identity Traits
- **The Curator**: Everything in her life is chosen intentionally — from her coffee mug to her lipstick
- **The Authenticity Seeker**: Can spot performative marketing from a mile away; craves the real thing
- **The Visual Thinker**: Sees the world in composition, color, and texture — makeup is another medium
- **The Anti-Conformist**: Deliberately avoids whatever "everyone" is doing

### Values
1. **Intentional design** — Everything should have purpose and beauty
2. **Authenticity over polish** — Real is more compelling than perfect
3. **Quality craftsmanship** — Appreciates the skill behind the product
4. **Sustainability** — Waste and excess packaging are aesthetic failures

### Worldview
She believes beauty should be effortless, not performative. The "no-makeup makeup" trend isn't a trend to her — it's common sense. She's drawn to founder stories, small batches, and brands that feel like they were made by a person, not a committee. She'd rather own three perfect products than thirty mediocre ones.

---

## The Emotional Landscape

### Fears
- Looking "basic" or like she's trying too hard
- Products that feel mass-produced or soulless
- Contributing to wasteful consumption
- Losing her unique aesthetic in a sea of sameness

### Desires
- Products that feel designed, not manufactured
- A makeup routine that's an extension of her creative practice
- To look effortlessly beautiful — like she woke up this way
- Brands she can genuinely recommend without feeling like a sellout

### Frustrations
- Overhyped products with no substance
- Excessive packaging that goes straight to landfill
- Beauty brands that feel corporate or disconnected from craft
- Makeup that looks "done" rather than natural

### Private Joys
- Finding a product that's as beautiful closed as it is open
- Someone asking "what are you wearing?" and having a real answer
- The tactile pleasure of quality textures
- Supporting a brand that aligns with her values

---

## The Minimalism Movement

### The Shift
The beauty industry is experiencing a "skinimalism" movement — a rejection of 12-step routines in favor of fewer, better products. This creative persona was ahead of this curve. She's been editing her routine for years.

### What She's Seeking
- **Capsule beauty**: The makeup equivalent of a capsule wardrobe
- **Multi-use products**: One thing that does many jobs beautifully
- **Considered packaging**: Design that's beautiful and functional, not wasteful
- **Founder-led brands**: Real stories, real vision, real craft

### The "Clean Girl" vs. The Creative
While the "clean girl aesthetic" has gone mainstream, the creative entrepreneur sees through trends. She wants the substance behind the style — not a look that's replicable by following a TikTok tutorial, but a genuine glow that comes from quality products applied with intention.

---

## Jobs To Be Done

### Functional Jobs
1. **Create a cohesive, natural look** with minimal products
2. **Multi-purpose application** — lips, cheeks, eyes from one product
3. **Quality textures** that feel luxurious and blend seamlessly
4. **Products that photograph well** for both selfies and professional shoots
5. **Travel-friendly essentials** for creative on-the-go lifestyle

### Emotional Jobs
1. **Feel aesthetically aligned** — her makeup reflects her taste
2. **Avoid the "makeup look"** — enhance, don't transform
3. **Experience sensory pleasure** in application — textures, scents, design
4. **Support brands she believes in** — purchases that feel good ethically

### Social Jobs
1. **Project creative confidence** — look put-together in professional settings
2. **Stand out subtly** — distinctive without being obvious
3. **Be a trusted resource** — the friend people ask for product recommendations
4. **Match her brand** — look consistent with her professional aesthetic

## Voice of Customer: What She Looks For

### On Minimalism

### On Packaging & Design
> "If I'm going to leave it on my bathroom counter, it better be beautiful."

## Purchase Psychology

### Triggers to Purchase
- Discovering a brand through an aesthetically aligned source (design blog, fellow creative)
- Seeing the product in a beautifully designed space (someone's bathroom shelfie)
- Learning the founder's story and feeling genuine resonance
- Running out of a product and wanting to upgrade rather than repurchase

### Objections & How to Overcome
| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "I don't need more products" | Position as editing down, not adding — one product replaces three |
| "Is it actually different?" | Lead with craft, ingredients, and Bobbi's 40-year expertise |
| "The price feels high" | Emphasize quality over quantity — buy less, buy better |
| "I've never heard of this brand" | Bobbi Brown's credibility + direct-to-consumer authenticity |

### Value Perception
- Researches thoroughly; reads ingredient lists
- Trusts founder stories over influencer endorsements
- Appreciates minimalist packaging as a sign of confidence
- Values "edited" over "extensive" product lines

## Day in Her Life (Freelance Designer Example)

**7:30 AM** — Wakes naturally. Makes pour-over coffee in her carefully chosen ceramic mug.

**8:00 AM** — Checks emails, reviews today's client projects. Works from home studio.

**8:30 AM** — Gets ready: minimal routine. Miracle Balm on cheeks and lips, mascara, done. 5 minutes.

**9:00 AM** — Deep work: design projects, client calls, creative problem-solving.

**12:00 PM** — Lunch break. Walks to local coffee shop with laptop for a change of scenery.

**1:00 PM** — Afternoon: more client work, admin tasks, invoicing (the unglamorous side).

**4:00 PM** — Errands or meeting with collaborator. Maybe a studio visit or gallery opening.

**6:00 PM** — Yoga or a run. Non-negotiable creative reset.

**7:30 PM** — Dinner — cooked at home or at the neighborhood spot where the owner knows her order.

**9:00 PM** — Personal creative time: side project, reading design blogs, sketching.

**11:00 PM** — Wind down. Skincare routine — simple, quality products. Bed.
