# Jones Road Beauty Brand Voice & Style Guide

## Brand Overview

### Mission
At Jones Road Beauty, we use makeup to empower generations of women to feel confident in their natural beauty and inspired to try new things. The product line is composed of clean, strategic, high-grade formulations that work on every skin tone and type — and support the idea that makeup should enhance who you are, not change it.

### Brand Philosophy
"The world doesn't need more beauty products. It needs better beauty products." - Bobbi Brown

Jones Road was born from Bobbi's search for something that didn't yet exist - "the makeup equivalent of a Swiss Army Knife: easy, cool, multi-purpose products that could be used to nail any look, whether it be no-makeup makeup or something with more drama."

### Brand Taglines
- Beauty, Reinvented.
- Makeup, Simplified.
- Know Who You Are. Own Who You Are.
- I Am Me.

### Philosophy Pillars

**Primary Pillars:**
- Makeup should enhance who you are, not change it or cover it up
- Beauty is how you feel, not just how you look
- Makeup should be simple enough to do anytime, anywhere

**Secondary Pillars:**
- Focus on what you love about your appearance and forget the rest
- You don't need more beauty products, just better beauty products
- Beauty has no expiration date

## Brand Personality & Core Values

### Authenticity & Honesty
We tell it like it is. The brand voice is genuine and transparent, avoiding exaggerated claims or gimmicks. Jones Road was built on Bobbi Brown's "lifetime of beauty knowledge, distilled" – our copy should reflect that by being truthful and expert. If a product is multi-purpose or requires a special technique, we plainly explain it (e.g., advising customers to "break the seal" on Miracle Balm). Honesty builds trust, so we embrace a no-BS attitude (in a polite way).

### Inclusivity & Empowerment
Jones Road is "clean beauty for everyone," with high-grade formulations that work for "all ages, skin types, and tones." Our language should be welcoming and inclusive, never alienating any group. We speak to a broad audience of makeup users—from teens to seniors—making everyone feel seen and empowered. Avoid stereotypes or assuming the reader has a certain look; instead celebrate individual beauty.

### Education & Expertise
One of Jones Road's core values is education. Bobbi Brown has always been a teacher at heart, and our copy carries that forward by being informative and helpful. We provide tips, how-tos, and clear instructions, positioning the brand as a friendly expert or mentor. The goal is to educate without lecturing – sharing knowledge in an approachable way.

### Simplicity & Minimalism
"Less, but better" is a mantra for both our products and our copy. Jones Road believes in "simple, smart products" and formulas that are "as simple to use as they are to master." Keep sentences concise and easy to read. Favor plain language over complex jargon. Our tone is minimalist – we don't clutter copy with superfluous adjectives or overblown descriptions. Every word counts.

### Quality & Cool Confidence
Jones Road's persona is confident in the high quality of its products and has a bit of cool factor (Bobbi often uses the word "cool" to describe the brand). The voice is self-assured and knows its products are good, without needing to shout about it. We avoid sounding arrogant; rather, we exude quiet confidence.

## Target Audience

Jones Road Beauty provides high quality beauty solutions for women who want to embrace their natural, authentic beauty and feel confident in their skin. The products are most suited for women who want to look fresh and glowing with minimal effort. Jones Road is ideal for women who are 25+ years old and represent all skin types, skin tones, ethnicities, and backgrounds.

### Our Customers
- Appreciate minimalist makeup
- New to makeup or don't particularly like traditional makeup
- Appreciate clean, skin-forward products
- Feel most comfortable with non-trendy classics
- Women of all generations who want to celebrate their natural skin

Due to the ultra-moisturizing nature of our hero products, they tend to appeal most to customers with dry skin. However, the full product line contains options for all skin types.

## Voice Principles

### Confident & Knowledgeable
Speak with self-assurance and clarity. Jones Road is founded by an industry icon, so our tone carries authority. We make definitive statements about our products' benefits (backed by Bobbi's expertise) without hedging or using weak language.

**Do:** "Miracle Balm is the secret to an effortless glow"
**Don't:** "We think Miracle Balm might be the secret"

Confidence also comes through in a solution-oriented tone – we sound like we have the answers (because we often do). We avoid phrases like "maybe try…" or excessive qualifiers. Instead, we use active voice and strong verbs.

### Direct
We keep our language clear, concise and direct. We don't need to get overly flowery when describing our products. We can say a lot by saying a little.

### Approachable
We want the novice and the newbie to feel comfortable in the world of Jones Road. Our language is approachable, never stuffy or overly complicated.

### Real
Just like Bobbi, we keep it real. We don't hide behind meaningless marketing language or confusing tutorials. We'll always be upfront and honest when answering customer questions and providing guidance.

### Natural & Authentic
Our writing should sound like a real person, not a corporate robot. Use straightforward language that people use in everyday conversation. Contractions are encouraged ("you'll love" instead of "you will love"). Being authentic also means our tone is personal and human – we share genuine enthusiasm for a product, or empathy for a customer need, in a down-to-earth way.

## Key Product Language

### IMPORTANT Brand Language Rules
- Always market with "moisturizing" - we don't use "hydrating" unless product has hydration testing (CAN say it for skincare products)
- Can always talk about Bobbi as a makeup artist and her origin story, but NOTHING that references her years at Bobbi Brown cosmetics
- Every single JR shade is a match to natural skin or complements natural skin tones - we can confidently say "you can't go wrong"
- Your Skin But Better - melts into your natural look, not intended to sit on top like a mask
- All products are infused with some kind of moisturizer
- Use "universal" only when something works for anyone (even MB is not "universal" but many eye colors are)
- Only products we call "matte": lip pencils and best eyeshadow - DON'T use "matte" for any other product, say "getting rid of excess shine"

### Miracle Balm
- First product, created the entire category - completely original to the brand
- "One and done"
- "Colorless glow" (for Au Naturel)
- Provides: moisture, luminosity/glow, tint, radiance, dewy finish
- Use: "skin-nourishing oils," "natural oils," "subtle radiance," "subtle sheen," "sheer wash of color"
- Application: pea-sized amount, cheeks first, tap (don't rub) for best results, "stippling" with everything brush
- AVOID: "buildable" for Miracle Balm
- Au Naturel is pink because of natural oils, a top seller because customers love skincare first
- Dusty Rose: a little bit of pink, light to medium skin tones, color corrects sallow skin, adds warmth
- Tawny: also corrects yellow, more brown
- Bronze: more orange, so color corrects redness
- Hour Shades: their purpose is just to highlight, high shimmer content, sparkle, multidimensional
- Happy Hour: more pearl-y color, different shimmer quality, be explicit about highlighter/shimmer qualities
- Fair/Dark skin tones: Red/Brown bronzer, deeper tones would do plum undertone for warmth
- End routine with Miracle Balm for final glow (powder on top will mattify)
- If you want more pigment, pair with another blush

### What The Foundation (WTF)
- "Tinted moisture balm meets traditional foundation"
- "Even, fresh complexion"
- "Enough but not too much"
- Light to medium buildable coverage
- Hybrid between skincare and makeup
- Oils and pigment whipped together - prevents drying down, overloaded with moisturizing ingredients
- The lightness allows for a generous shade match - they "sheer out" on the skin
- We encourage summer and winter shades, and mixing both together in the in-between months
- The Spatula: the divot creates the perfect amount for your face
- Start at the center of the face and pull out from there, add more where needed
- WTF first, then go over with Face Pencil
- Use "glow" for WTF

### The Face Pencil
- "Creamy yet richly pigmented"
- "Buildable to full coverage"
- Creamy enough that it glides and blends out, dense enough that it stays put throughout the day
- Wood retains the moisture inside
- Great for spots, hyperpigmentation, brightening under eyes
- Great "on the go" product
- Should be a shade match, most likely 2 different shades for different times of the year
- Only our sharpener will work with it
- Use "creamy" and "skin-nourishing oils"

### The Neutralizer
- Pink cap vs bone cap
- Counters darkness in the skin, blue or yellow under eye undertones
- Most likely you use on undereyes and on hyperpigmentation
- It HAS to be followed up with the Face Pencil
- Use "creamy" and "skin-nourishing oils"

### The Mascara
- "Inky, jet black, standout"
- Blackest "clean" mascara
- Suits everyone
- Adds definition to lashes
- The brush is curved side up, use the tip for bottom lashes and corners

### Bronzers
- Dusty Rose: great powder for no-makeup makeup, light to medium skin tone (NOT a blush)
- Born out of how people actually tan
- Sunkissed vs suntanned: gel bronzer is made to literally tint your skin to a suntanned look
- Sunkissed is sun bouncing off the skin look

### Shimmer Face Oil
- Finely milled shimmers, a highlight at the end of the day
- "Thin veil of highlight"
- Pink opal really only for fair
- Bronze for darker, gold toned highlight
- Cool rose and midas most popular

### Tinted Face Powder
- Untinted is core white, nothing added
- Sets makeup, mattifies certain areas (like t zones)
- Banana powder sets undereye makeup - we recommend as setting powder for undereye
- Pink tones are not blushes (but customers use them that way)

### Brushes
- Professional grade, made in Italy, made to last, made to keep forever
- "Even, well-blended makeup" - this is an investment piece, high quality

### Sparkle Wash + Just a Sec
- Shimmer can seem done up (we spend a lot of time on how to talk about shimmer for mature skin)
- Cream shadow
- Effortless, easy, not highly pigmented
- All shadows are buildable, pretty low pigment
- "Adding dimension" to the eye = highlighting thing
- "Defining/adding definition" = eyeliner or mascara
- "Enhancing" the eyes = all of these
- "Brightening" the eyes = canceling darkness/redness
- "Highlight" = the brow bone or with shimmer
- "Complement/ary shades" = shades that correspond to eye color

### Best Eye Shadow
- Chic and cream are the base of any eye look (can use as primer for oily lids)
- 3 cool and 3 warm matte, 3 cool and 3 warm shimmer
- Cool tones for eyes make eyes look brighter/more alive (according to Bobbi)
- Grouping them as "cool" and "warm" sounds more accessible

### Lip and Cheek Stick
- "Multipurpose product"
- Not made with powder, it's liquid pigment "will not dry down," "stays creamy on the skin"
- Upgrades miracle balm to add pigment, never ends up looking overly dewy

### Lip Pencils
- Designed as natural nude lip colors
- Not so creamy that it "feathers" over the lip line, "glides" on really well
- "Line your lips and then fill/draw in, blot lips together"

### Skincare
- Undereye cream is makeup prep, adds moisture and bounce - "skin prep, step one" (we rarely use word "primer")
- Oil Stick: spot treatment for dry patches
- Miracle Cream: you have to break the seal

### Kits & Holiday
- "Statement, definition, effortless" - somewhat neutral and universal in terms of shades
- Should be tied to ease of use, not an intimidating routine
- Hero kit will have all "award-winning" products
- A complete look on its own, or you can add on more

### How We Talk About Popular Products
- We don't say "favorites" or "best" because there's different options for everyone
- Use: "here's a great place to start," "oily skin should try this," "fair skin might love this"
- Popular products should be discerned by what works for you
- Bobbi has to love every product equally
