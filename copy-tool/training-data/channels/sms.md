# SMS Copy Framework

## Overview
SMS is the most direct channel. Every character counts. Lead with the hook, deliver value fast, and make the CTA unmissable.

### 2. Product Spotlight
**Goal:** Focus on one hero product. Emphasize key benefits, why we love it, problem it solves, when/how to use. Adding seasonality is a great plus.

**Examples:**
```

### 3. Product Roundup / Series
**Goal:** Highlight a group of products under a common theme (e.g. "No-Makeup Makeup", "Summer Skin Set", "Best of Bronze"). Great for editorial-style curation in a tight format.

**Examples:**
```

With Everyday Sunscreen, a dab of Miracle Balm, and a swipe of The Lippie Stick, your look is ready for a day of sun and sand.

### 4. Category Push
**Goal:** Drive traffic to a specific category (e.g. Skincare, Lips, Eyes). Reinforce with a seasonal or need-based hook.

**Examples:**
```
Hot weather, cool lips.
Our lineup was made for summer. Lightweight, sheer washes of color you can apply without a mirror - and without any stickiness.

### 5. Social Proof / Reviews
**Goal:** Use short customer quotes or review snippets to validate the product. Great for reminding repeat customers or nudging those on the fence.

**Examples:**
```

But don't just take our word for it: "This is the perfect way to carry Miracle Balm. The three colors are great and work beautifully together!"

"I love how buildable the colors are. I can wear them sheer or build for a more vibrant effect."

```

---

### 6. Sale or Promotion Alert
**Goal:** Announce a promotion on site — % off, sitewide promos, or bundles. Always lead with the offer and urgency. CTA should be shop-driven.

**Examples:**
```
(Mini) Miracles do happen... The Black Friday Sale is here.
The highly requested Mini Miracle Balm Set is back, along with a special deal for up to 25% off kits.

### 8. Educational
**Goal:** Share quick "how to" content, step routines, or problem-solution approaches. Include a CTA to shop the featured product.

**Examples:**
```
Tired of stubborn dark circles?
Brighten your look with The Neutralizer Pencil! It color corrects for a refreshed appearance.

```
Breaking out? Just Enough has you covered.
Our new Tinted Moisturizer is the secret to a confident complexion. It's light, hydrating, and non-comedogenic - so you can even the redness without clogging pores.

```

---

### 9. Cross-Sell / Upsell
**Goal:** Suggest complementary products after purchase or to pair with their faves.

**Examples:**
```
Should you use a brush or your fingers to apply What The Foundation?
Using your fingers helps to press the product into your skin for a sheer finish. A brush helps to distribute the product evenly while providing slightly more coverage.
Our favorite brush to use with WTF is The Skin Brush: [link]
```

```
After you apply The Mascara, finish the look by lining your eyes with The Best Pencil.
This classic combination creates the perfect amount of definition for stand out eyes: [link]
```

```
Love the moisture from Miracle Balm but want more color?
The Lip & Cheek Stick is ideal for layering. It's creamy, yet buildable color formula pairs perfectly with Miracle Balm.
Available in 8 shades: [link]

## Best Practices & Rules

### Character Limits
- **MUST keep under 120 characters** including spaces and line breaks
- Every character counts — be ruthless with edits

### Structure
- **First line = hook** — grab attention fast, optimize it like a subject line
- Lead with what's new, best, or expiring
- Be clear, skimmable, and conversational
- Only ONE idea per SMS — don't mix multiple CTAs
- Always include a CTA + short link at the end

### Tone
- Friendly, slightly editorial
- No fluff, confident, minimal, helpful
- NOT overly salesy or hypey
- Plain, direct language

### Formatting Rules
- Don't overdo punctuation (limit ! or caps)
- **Don't use emojis**
- Use line breaks for readability
- Keep paragraphs short (1-2 sentences max)

### Testing Ideas
- Tone variations: playful vs. straightforward
- Urgency cues: "Now live" vs. "Ends tonight"
- CTA phrasing: "Shop now" vs. "Get the kit" vs. "Grab yours"
