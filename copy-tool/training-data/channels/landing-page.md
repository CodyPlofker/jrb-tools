Guidelines for writing landing page copy for paid traffic in the Jones Road voice.

---

## Channel Characteristics

| Attribute | Landing Page |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Mindset** | Clicked from an ad — curious but skeptical |
| **Attention** | Higher intent, but easy to bounce |
| **Length** | Long-form OK if structured well |
| **Tone** | Focused, persuasive, single-minded |
| **Goal** | Continue the ad's promise → Build belief → Convert |

## Critical Rule: Match the Ad

The landing page MUST continue the conversation started by the ad.

**If the ad says:** "Tired of foundation making you look older?"
**The landing page should NOT:** Open with a generic brand story

**The landing page SHOULD:** "Heavy foundation settles into fine lines. Here's what to do instead."

**Principle:** Same problem, same promise, deeper explanation.

## Landing Page Structure

### Hero Section (Above the Fold)
What they see first. Make or break.

**Elements:**
- **Headline:** Continues/expands the ad promise
- **Subheadline:** Clarifies or adds context
- **Hero image:** Product or result
- **CTA button:** Clear, singular action

**Example:**
- **Headline:** "The No-Makeup Makeup for Real Life"
- **Subheadline:** "Look polished in 5 minutes with clean, skin-loving ingredients"
- **CTA:** "Shop Miracle Balm"

### Problem Section
Agitate the problem they clicked about.

**Purpose:** Make them feel understood. Show you get their frustration.

**Structure:**
- Describe the problem vividly
- Show you understand why it's frustrating
- Hint that there's a better way

**Example:**
"Heavy foundation doesn't just look obvious — it actually makes you look older. It settles into fine lines. Emphasizes texture. And requires constant touch-ups. You've tried 'natural' options, but they never deliver. There's a reason for that."

### Solution Section
Introduce your approach (not just your product).

**Purpose:** Present the unique mechanism. Why THIS works.

**Structure:**
- The insight/new way of thinking
- How your approach is different
- Brief product introduction

**Example:**
"The problem isn't your skin — it's your foundation. Jones Road takes a different approach: enhancement, not coverage. Miracle Balm delivers luminosity through hydration, not shimmer. It works WITH your skin instead of sitting on top of it."

### Proof Section
Build belief with evidence.

**Elements:**
- **Reviews/Testimonials:** Real customer quotes
- **Numbers:** "29,931 five-star reviews"
- **Authority:** Bobbi Brown's expertise
- **Before/After or Results:** Visual proof

**Example:**
"'The amount of compliments I receive when I have this on is unbelievable.' — 5-star review"

"Created by Bobbi Brown, the woman who revolutionized natural makeup. This is her vision, realized."

### Product Details
What they're actually getting.

**Elements:**
- What's included
- How to use
- Key ingredients
- Shade options

**Keep it scannable:** Bullet points, icons, short descriptions.

### CTA Section
Final push to convert.

**Elements:**
- Restate the benefit
- Clear CTA button
- Risk reducer (free shipping, returns, etc.)

**Example:**
"Ready to ditch heavy makeup for good?"
[Shop Miracle Balm]
"Free shipping on orders $50+ | Easy returns"

## Landing Page Best Practices

### Navigation
**Rule:** NO full navigation menu on paid traffic landing pages.

**Why:** They came for one thing. Don't distract them with options.

**Acceptable:** Logo (links to home), CTA button only.

### Single Focus
One product or one offer. Not "browse our collection."

If the ad was about Miracle Balm, the page is about Miracle Balm.

### Social Proof Placement
- Near the hero (builds immediate trust)
- After the problem section (proof there's a better way)
- Near the CTA (final validation)

### Mobile First
Most traffic is mobile. Design and write for thumb-scrollers.

- Short paragraphs
- Clear headers
- Tappable CTAs
- Fast load time

## Landing Page Types

### Problem-Focused (Cold Traffic)
For prospects who don't know Jones Road yet.

**Structure:**
1. Problem headline
2. Agitate problem
3. Introduce solution/mechanism
4. Product details
5. Social proof
6. CTA

### Persona-Focused
For campaigns targeting specific personas.

**Example:** Landing page for "busy moms"
- Headline: "The 3-Minute Face for Moms Who Have No Time"
- Problem: Juggling everything, no time for a routine
- Solution: Multi-use products, finger application
- Proof: Reviews from other moms

### Product Launch
For new product or collection announcements.

**Structure:**
1. Announcement headline
2. What's new/special
3. What's included
4. Bobbi's perspective
5. Social proof (if available)
6. CTA
