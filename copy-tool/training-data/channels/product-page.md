## PDP Structure

### Product Title
Clear, branded product name.

**Format:** "The [Product Name]" or "[Product Name]"

**Examples:**
- Miracle Balm
- What The Foundation
- The Best Pencil
- The Bobbi Kit 5.0

### Short Description (Above the Fold)
1-2 sentences visible immediately. The hook.

**Focus:** Primary benefit + what it is

**Example:**
"A hydrating, multi-use balm that gives skin a natural, lit-from-within glow. Use on cheeks, lips, and eyes."

### Long Description
The full story. Scannable with clear sections.

**Structure:**
1. **Opening paragraph** - What it is, primary benefit
2. **Why We Love It** - Emotional benefits, Bobbi's perspective
3. **How It's Different** - Unique mechanism, differentiation
4. **Details** - Ingredients, shades, how to use

### Bobbi's Tip (When Applicable)
Direct voice from Bobbi. Expert advice, personal recommendation.

**Format:** Italicized, personal, practical

**Example:**
"Genius in a pot. Once you break the seal of the balm, you can wear it alone, or use it to bronze, highlight, or tint the skin by mixing and matching shades."

### Social Proof
Reviews, ratings, testimonials.

**Best Placement:** Near CTA, after description

**Example:**
"★★★★★ 29,931 5-Star Reviews"
"'The amount of compliments I receive when I have this on is unbelievable.'"

## Section Templates

### Opening Paragraph
[What it is] + [Primary benefit] + [Who it's for or how to use]

**Example:**
"The Body Collection transforms your existing everyday rituals, making them more luxurious. The collection consists of five intentional formulas — Body Cream, Body Lotion, Body Oil, Body Scrub, and Shower Gel. Each is enriched with ceramides and other deeply nourishing ingredients to comfort dryness, restore softness, and support overall skin health."

### Why We Love It
[Emotional benefit] + [Bobbi's perspective] + [Versatility]

**Example:**
"Classic, versatile, and universally flattering, these are Bobbi's must-haves of the season for feeling polished without the effort. The Bobbi Kit 5.0 creates a laid-back, statement look by pairing brand new favorites with fresh takes on the effortless staples you love."

### How It's Different
[Unique mechanism] + [Differentiation from alternatives] + [Proof point]

**Example:**
"This is the first Bobbi Kit to offer five fully exclusive products that are versatile enough to be dressed up or down. It features a first look at a new effortless product, The Eyeshadow Stick, as well as The Lip in Batch 18 — the tinted lip balm that inspired Bobbi to launch Jones Road."

## Product-Specific Copy Elements

### Shade/Color Descriptions
Specific, visual, helpful for selection.

**Example (Miracle Balm shades):**
- **Au Naturel:** No color. Just luminosity from moisture content. Use all the time.
- **Dusty Rose:** Such beautiful color. Enhances a lot of skin tones. Makes fair women look like they have the perfect pink blush on. And makes darker skin women have the perfect little highlight.
- **Magic Hour:** Perfect for when you want just some luminosity, a little bit of highlight, a little bit of shine.

### How to Use
Practical, simple instructions.

**Format:** Numbered steps or short paragraph

**Example:**
"Apply with fingers to cheeks, lips, and eyelids for an instant glow. Layer for more intensity or wear alone for a natural look. Mix shades to customize your perfect color."

### Ingredients (When Relevant)
Highlight key ingredients with benefits.

**Format:** Ingredient + benefit

**Example:**
- **Ceramides:** Restore skin's natural barrier
- **Vitamin E:** Antioxidant protection
- **Jojoba Oil:** Deep, lasting hydration

## What Works for Jones Road PDP Copy

### DO:
- Lead with benefit, not features
- Use "Why We Love It" and "How It's Different" sections
- Include Bobbi's voice/tips
- Be specific about shades and uses
- Show versatility (multiple uses)
- Keep it scannable (headers, short paragraphs)
- Include social proof near CTA

### DON'T:
- Lead with ingredients (benefit first)
- Write walls of text without headers
- Use generic beauty language ("revolutionary," "breakthrough")
- Overpromise ("erases wrinkles")
- Forget the emotional benefit (it's not just what it does, it's how it makes you feel)

## Jones Road PDP Voice Notes

- **Confident, not boastful:** "This is a friggin miracle" (Bobbi's voice), not "THE BEST BALM EVER MADE"
- **Informative, not overwhelming:** Give them what they need to decide, not a science lecture
- **Warm, not clinical:** "Comforts dryness" not "Combats transepidermal water loss"
- **Specific, not vague:** "Makes fair women look like they have the perfect pink blush on" not "Looks great on everyone"
