# Meta Ads (Facebook & Instagram)

Guidelines for writing Meta ad copy in the Jones Road voice. This covers both **Ad Copy** (text fields around the ad) and **Static Creative** (text overlays on the image itself).

---

## Channel Characteristics

| Attribute | Meta Ads |
|-----------|----------|
| **Mindset** | Scrolling, not shopping — you're interrupting |
| **Attention** | 1-3 seconds to hook them |
| **Length** | Short to medium (test both) |
| **Tone** | Punchy, relatable, problem-first |
| **Goal** | Stop scroll → Click → Convert |

---

## Ad Type 1: Ad Copy

These are the text fields that appear around the ad creative in Meta's interface.

### Primary Text (Above the Image)
The main copy that appears above your creative.

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (first line) - Stop the scroll with problem or identity
2. **Bridge** - Connect problem to solution
3. **Benefit/Proof** - Why this works
4. **CTA** - What to do next (optional, button handles this)

**Length Guidelines:**
- Short version: 1-2 sentences (visible without "See more")
- Long version: 3-5 sentences (for high-ticket or unfamiliar products)
- Test both — there's no universal rule

**Hook appears before "See more"** — make it count.

### Headline (Below Image in Link Preview)
Short, punchy statement in the link preview area.

**Best Practices:**
- 5-10 words max
- Benefit-driven or identity-driven
- Can use light humor

**Examples:**
- "The no-makeup makeup for chronically late people"
- "Deeply Hydrates Thirsty Skin"
- "Dewy Skin Made Easy"

### Link Description
Secondary text in link preview. Supports the headline.

**Best Practices:**
- Reinforce positioning
- Keep it short (1 sentence)

**Examples:**
- "Clean no-makeup makeup."
- "5 intentional formulas for everyday rituals."

## Ad Type 2: Static Creative

Copy that appears ON the image itself as text overlays. This is different from Ad Copy — it's the creative asset.

### Creative Headline
The main text overlay on the image. This is the hero text.

**Best Practices:**
- 3-8 words MAX (it needs to be readable at small sizes)
- Bold, attention-grabbing
- Can be benefit, identity, or problem-based
- Font size matters — shorter is often better

**Examples:**
- "Your 5-Minute Glow"
- "The Kit Everyone's Asking About"
- "Finally. Makeup That Looks Like Skin."
- "Busy? Same."
- "Effortless Starts Here"

### Creative Subhead
Secondary text that supports the headline. Not always needed.

**Best Practices:**
- 5-15 words
- Adds context or benefit detail
- Smaller font than headline

**Examples:**
- "3 products. One effortless routine."
- "The clean beauty kit created by Bobbi Brown"
- "For women who want compliments, not questions"

### Body Text (Optional)
Longer copy if the layout calls for it. Use sparingly.

**Best Practices:**
- 1-2 sentences max
- Only if the creative format supports it
- Should be readable at small sizes

### CTA Text
Button or action text on the creative itself.

**Best Practices:**
- 2-4 words
- Action-oriented
- Clear next step

**Examples:**
- "Shop Now"
- "Get the Kit"
- "Try It"
- "See Why"
- "Shop the Glow"

### Badge/Callout Text
Small highlight text (e.g., "NEW", "Best Seller", savings).

**Examples:**
- "NEW"
- "Best Seller"
- "Save 20%"
- "Limited Edition"
- "As Seen In..."

## Hook Formulas That Work

### Problem-First Hooks
- "Tired of [problem]?"
- "[Problem] is the worst."
- "If [problem], this is for you."

**Examples:**
- "Tired of foundation making you look older?"
- "If your makeup routine takes longer than your commute, this is for you."

### Identity-First Hooks (Level 5 Market)
- "The [product] for [identity]"
- "For [identity] who [situation]"
- "[Product] for people who [behavior]"

**Examples:**
- "The no-makeup makeup for chronically late people."
- "For women who do makeup because they want to, not because they have to."

### Contrarian/Positioning Hooks
- "Forget [old way]."
- "Stop [common behavior]."
- "[Number] steps? Please."

**Examples:**
- "Forget 12 steps."
- "Stop covering your skin. Start enhancing it."

### Direct Benefit Hooks
- "Get [benefit] without [sacrifice]"
- "[Benefit] in [timeframe]"

**Examples:**
- "Get a natural glow without the 10-step routine."
- "Look put-together in 5 minutes."

## What Works for Jones Road Ads

### DO:
- Lead with relatable problems (tired, busy, frustrated)
- Use light, dry humor
- Position against complexity (12 steps, heavy makeup, trying too hard)
- Show real results (social proof, reviews)
- Speak to specific personas when possible
- Keep it conversational, not salesy
- For static creative: Keep text SHORT and readable

### DON'T:
- Use fear/shame about aging
- Overpromise ("look 10 years younger")
- Sound like every other beauty brand
- Use fake urgency
- Be too clever at the expense of clarity
- Overcrowd the creative with text

## Static Creative: Reference Analysis

When a reference creative is uploaded, analyze:

1. **Layout structure** - Where are text zones positioned?
2. **Text hierarchy** - What's the headline vs. supporting text?
3. **Character counts** - How long is each text element?
4. **Visual style** - Is text bold, subtle, overlaid, contained in boxes?
5. **Number of zones** - How many separate text areas?

Then generate Jones Road copy for EACH zone, matching the approximate length and placement of the reference.

## Testing Notes

- Test short vs. long primary text
- Test problem-first vs. identity-first hooks
- Test persona-specific vs. general messaging
- Test with and without social proof in primary text
- Test question hooks vs. statement hooks
- For static creative: Test text-heavy vs. minimal designs
