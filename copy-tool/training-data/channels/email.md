### Subject Lines

- Use personalization sparingly and authentically
- Avoid spam triggers (FREE!!!, ACT NOW, etc.)
- Test curiosity vs. clarity for your audience

**Formulas That Work:**

- Add context or a secondary hook
- Keep under 90 characters

**Example:**

### Body Copy
- Lead with value, not the brand name
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Make it scannable with headlines and spacing
- One primary CTA per email (secondary CTAs okay)
- Write like you're talking to one person
- Use "you" more than "we"

### Tone Guidelines (Jones Road Voice)
- Confident, not salesy
- Warm, not corporate
- Educational, not pushy
- Authentic, not trying too hard
- Inclusive, not exclusive

### Words to Use
- Effortless, natural, glow, enhance
- Clean, simple, curated
- Confidence, real, fresh
- Your skin, your way

### Words to Avoid

- Combat, fight, eliminate (too aggressive)
