# Listicle Landing Page Framework

## Overview
Listicle landing pages use a numbered "X Reasons Why" format to present benefits in a scannable, persuasive way. This format works exceptionally well for product launches, kits, and converting problem-aware audiences.

**Key Principle: Scannability over completeness.** People skim, not read. Headlines do the heavy lifting.

---

## Copy Length Requirements

| Element | Target | Maximum |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Hero headline** | 7-10 words | 12 words |
| **Item headlines** | 5-7 words | 9 words |
| **Supporting copy** | 40-55 words | 65 words |

**Why these limits matter:** Competitor analysis shows high-converting listicle pages use concise headlines while maintaining product specificity. Balance scannability with enough detail to be compelling (include product names, key benefits, differentiators).

---

## Headline Variations

**IMPORTANT: Generate 3-5 headline variations using different styles below. This allows for testing different angles.**

### Style 1: Desire/Benefit-Driven
Focus on what the customer GETS or BECOMES. Clear, aspirational, direct.

**Examples (7-10 words):**
- "5 Reasons the Dusty Rose Kit Changes Everything"
- "Why This Pink Kit Makes Mornings Effortless"
- "5 Ways to Get Effortless Elegance Fast"

### Style 2: Curiosity/FOMO (Cosmo-style)
Create intrigue with an open loop. Think magazine cover energy — make them NEED to know.

**Examples (7-10 words):**
- "Why Everyone's Asking About the Dusty Rose Kit"
- "The Pink Kit Women Keep Coming Back For"
- "5 Things Nobody Tells You About Effortless Makeup"

### Style 3: Identity-Based
Speak to who they are or want to be.

**Examples (7-10 words):**
- "For Women Who Want Easy, Polished Makeup"
- "5 Reasons Busy Women Love the Dusty Rose Kit"
- "The Kit for Women With High Standards"

### Style 4: Contrarian/Myth-Busting
Challenge common beliefs or offer a surprising take. Bold, confident.

**Examples (7-10 words):**
- "Forget the Trends: Soft Pink Is Always Right"
- "Why Less Makeup Actually Looks Better on You"
- "3 Products Beat a 10-Product Routine Every Time"

### Style 5: Problem-Aware (Softer approach)
Acknowledge the frustration gently, then pivot to solution. Avoid overly negative language.

**Examples (7-10 words):**
- "Running Late? The Dusty Rose Kit Has You"
- "Finally, Makeup Shades That Actually Work Together"
- "5 Reasons Your Mornings Just Got Easier"

**NOTE:** Avoid "Tired of X?" phrasing — it can feel too salesy/aggressive for Jones Road's voice.

## Page Structure

### 1. Hero Section
```
[Hero Image - Product or Lifestyle]

[HEADLINE: 7-10 words, max 12]

[SHOP NOW Button]
```

- Clean, minimal hero
- Headline is the star
- Single CTA button
- Optional: Social proof snippet (star rating, review count)

### 2. Intro Paragraph [OPTIONAL]
```
[1-2 sentences that set up the list and create anticipation]
```

**When to include:** Only if needed to provide context or bridge from ad messaging.
**When to skip:** For most listicles, jump straight into the numbered items.

### 3. List Items (5-7 items)

**Each item follows this format:**
```
[CATEGORY LABEL - Optional]                    [Number]

[Benefit Headline - 5-7 words]

[Supporting copy - 40-55 words, 2-3 short sentences]

[SHOP NOW]

[Accompanying Image]
```

**Item Structure Rules:**
- Number displayed prominently (01, 02, 03 or 1. 2. 3.)
- Optional category label above headline (e.g., "CONVENIENCE", "QUALITY", "VALUE")
- Benefit headline: **5-7 words**, action-oriented, scannable
- Supporting copy: **40-55 words**, conversational, tight
- "SHOP NOW" link after each item (keeps momentum)
- Image alternates sides (left/right) for visual interest

### 4. Final CTA Section
```
[Summary Headline - restate the value]

[Brief offer details or urgency element]

[Primary CTA Button]
```

---

## Category Labels [OPTIONAL]

Category labels add a second level of scannability. They appear above the item number in small caps.

**When to use:** When you want readers to quickly identify benefit areas at a glance.

**Example categories:**
- CONVENIENCE / TIME
- QUALITY / FORMULA
- VALUE / SAVINGS
- RESULTS / PROOF
- EXPERTISE / TRUST

**Format:**
```
CONVENIENCE                                    01

Ready in Half the Time

Three products. One look. No guesswork...
```

---

## Item Ordering Strategy

The ORDER of your list items matters for persuasion. **Lead with benefits (what's in it for them), build with proof, close with value.**

| Position | Purpose | What to Include | Example Headline |
|----------|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Items 1-2** | Benefits & Desires | Time savings, ease, confidence | "Get Ready in Half the Time" |
| **Items 3-4** | Features & Mechanism | How/why it works, what's different | "Shades That Actually Work Together" |
| **Item 5** | Social Proof & Credibility | Created by Bobbi, loved by customers | "Created by Bobbi Brown for Real Life" |
| **Item 6** | Objection Handling | Works for everyone, easy to use | "Works for Every Skin Tone and Age" |
| **Final Item** | Value & Risk Reversal | Savings, guarantee, returns | "Save 33% vs. Buying Separately" |

**Key Principle:** Start with THEM (benefits), move to US (how it works), close with PROOF and VALUE.
