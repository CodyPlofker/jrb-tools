### Launch Overview
The Eyeshadow Stick is officially launching in a range of 8 matte shades. The product was born from the desire to have an eyeshadow that checks the following boxes:
- Incredibly easy to use & beginner friendly
- Doesn't require a brush
- Can be used day or night, casually or dramatically
- Universal, matte shades that work well on all skin tones
- Complementary shades that pair well together for any layered look you might want

The Eyeshadow Stick joins our family of 3 existing eyeshadows: Just A Sec, The Best Eyeshadow, and Sparkle Wash. The difference between the shadows is in the formula, finish and how they are applied.

At the moment we are keeping our shade range to only matte neutrals. However, if the product is received well we may develop additional shades for a more comprehensive range.

### Target Demographic
Truth is, The Eyeshadow Stick is a product that most makeup lovers will get a lot of value from. Even those who don't typically wear eyeshadow will like The Eyeshadow Stick.

It goes against most eye-makeup rules. Most people who opt not to wear makeup do so because of the skill it often requires to wear eye makeup. This is the opposite. You can throw it on quickly, smudge it a bit and still look amazing. It's a mistake-proof way to create eye definition — swipe, smudge, and go.

So who are we targeting?
- The modern 30+ woman who appreciates neutral, classic looks that are effortless and can be easily adjusted based on the occasion.
- She is the same person who appreciates a classic button down, a staple watch and trench coat.
- She appreciates simple things - the simplicity of The Eyeshadow Stick is appealing since it's not overdone or overpowering.
- She values versatility - would likely want 2-3 shades to create 10 different looks
- She considers her aesthetic range from everyday-simple to timelessly-bold
