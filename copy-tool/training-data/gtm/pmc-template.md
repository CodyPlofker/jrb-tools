## Example: The Eyeshadow Stick PMC

**Status**: Approved on 11/11/25

### POSITIONING

**Tagline**: Not-So-Basic Basics

**What It Is**: The Eyeshadow Stick is a creamy, highly pigmented shadow that transforms without trying. The lightweight formula lets you customize your look from one simple sweep to a layered statement. It locks onto lids for long-lasting wear without creasing or transferring. Available in 8 neutral matte shades, this is a modern eyeshadow that glides on beautifully and blends in effortlessly.

**Why We Love It**: One stick, unlimited looks. With a range of versatile, classic shades, The Eyeshadow Stick proves that simplicity can be striking. It's flattering in any eye look, whether you're going for a hint of color or bold definition. Not to mention, the long-lasting formula is infused with Vitamin E and Soybean Oil to give it a creamy and comfortable feel.

**How It's Different**: The secret to The Eyeshadow Stick is its formula. The ultra-rich, creamy texture is what makes it easy to glide on, build up, and adjust before locking into place all day. Even if you're new to eyeshadow, this is the smoothest and simplest one to master. It won't crease or transfer, it's free of talc and silicones, and is dermatologist tested. Developed in classic shades that flatter everyone, it's the kind of basic that checks every box.

### MESSAGING

**How To Use**: Apply The Eyeshadow Stick directly to your eyelids, and blend using your fingertip for a soft, seamless finish. For a more diffused look, blend using the Eye Fluffy Brush. For a bolder look, build up the intensity by pairing multiple shades for depth and definition. For oily lids, prep with a light, all-over dusting of Tinted Face Powder or The Best Eyeshadow.

**Who It's For**: Even if you're someone who doesn't typically wear eyeshadow, this is perfect for anyone who wants a quick, mistake-proof way to create eye definition — swipe, smudge, and go.
